# Work Day Scheduler
## A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day
This is a calendar application to save events for each hour during normal business hours. The app runs in the browser and data is stored locally when the user presses the save button. 

The application uses day.js (https://day.js.org/) for the time keeping and date display. 

The time will be updated each day and displayed at the top, and as each hour passes the coloring of each input area will change to display either past (grey), current (red), or future (green).
